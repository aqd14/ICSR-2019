If you visit a site which requires ActiveX, Browzar will simply not download the ActiveX component. In the event that you visit a site using Browzar which has already been visited using Internet Explorer and an ActiveX component has already been downloaded to the computer you are using, then this ActiveX component will still run in Browzar.

Ease of use: Tabbed Browsing (with no delete buttons on the actual tabs so you don't accidentaly delete a tab). Browsing speed faster than you can say jack-in-a-box (depending on the size of the website).  Shares add-ons from IE (accessed from right clicking the browser). Shares browsing history and cache and cookies with IE so you only need to delete one set of browsing history. Search box with user chosen search providers. Fast and easy to use favourites window. Video buffering speed is trippled (especially on youtube and google video).  Loading text tells you what website and what part of the website is loading at that second.
Security: High strength Web Encryption (It clearly tells you when the website is encrypted, so you don't have to worry about if it's safe to type in your login or credit card info). Highly Secure Parenting control web-site blocker (not even the brainiest kid can breakthrough the encrypted password need to access the blocked website). Private browsing tab (nothing is saved from your browsing, parenting control web-site blocker will still be active in a private browsing tab). Phishing filter allows you to block suspected fraudulent web-sites (so you don't run the risk of going on them).
Very stable browsing: hardly ever does a tab lock up or close for no reason, and if it does the whole program won't have to close. Only that particular tab is affected, you can also delete the tab even if it locks up. The browser hardly ever locks up (depending on how many other programs you are running). Add any amount of tabs and the program still runs smoothly.
Real multi browsing - surf with multiple browsers at once. Each window is a browser, the use is intuitively, simple and fast. Minimal mouse movements, no toolbar overflooding, more rendering space.
Surfing is more secure based on 'Windows XP/SP2 - Security Feature Control Opt-In'. With the security report window, you can view your security settings.

Fully adjustable split screen browsing environment. Muddly supports 4 panes, Top, Bottom, Right and Left. These panes can be further divided for precise control of composite documents. All panes support tabs and all panes can be maximized.
Muddly documents allow you to compile a web archive using your Windows file system. This allows you to collect many documents containing all the sites of interest for that document without cluttering your Favorites collection. Whatever you have on screen under a document tab can be saved in the Muddly .mud file format. You can open and restore your content and layout anytime later. As files they can be sent as file attachments in E-mail etc.
You can open one or more RSS feeds in the Muddly Tree Browser - this allows you to view any page in a feed without opening more than one browser pane - giving you more control of your favorite feeds. If required you can open any item in a new tab, window or document. Feeds are integral with the document - when you save a document that contains a feed - it will open along with the other document content when you return to it.
The Muddly Tree Browser works the same way with your Favorites too - this is the fastest, most convenient way to look through your Favorites and find the page you are looking for with just one view. It's the same story for your History too.
Muddly isn't trying to replace the rich functionality and special features of Internet Explorer - we dont ask you to make it your default browser or change anything at all. Muddly has a unique feature set and its own place in your software inventory.
Muddly turns the web into a well organised reference - and there'll be certain documents you'll want to refer to all of the time. When you don't need it on the desktop you can reduce it to the system tray ready when you need it.
Muddly looks great with a skin to suit your taste - browsing feels better too when you decide on the ambience.
