system should if you don t like to see those checksum file no problem checksum can create and verify hidden checksum file a easily a visible one like most option a well a on the fly configuration via the option dialog hold down shift when you launch checksum you can set this permanently by altering checksum ini
system should to create hidden checksum same a attrib h use h on the command line or choose that option from the option dialog
system should don t worry about creating music playlist with the invisible option enabled the playlist will be perfectly visible only the checksum get hidden well someone asked o
system should handy if you are making scheduled item etc and want to disable all the dialog simply add a q

system should user preference are stored in a plain text window ini file
system should you can look at it edit it back it up script with it and handle it lot of thing can be tweaked and set from here though of people will probably find the default are just fine and the one shot option dialog handle everything else they could ever need but if you are a more advanced user with special requirement chance are checksum ha a setting just for you click here to find out more about checksum ini
