File Sharing,eMule-plus-plus,Part Traffic: spreading information in p2p applications is vital. Knowing which files are already well spread and which are not is something that releasers request a lot.

File Sharing,eMule-plus-plus,"Upload System (zz): the ed2k protocol has been designed in a way only full chunks are shared. As chunks have a size of 9Mb you need to complete them before sharing that part to the world. The zz Upload System prioritizes the upload of full chunks while maximizing your upload speed with trickle slots. These slots use the remaining bandwidth not used by the other downloading clients.

By sending folder links, friends and family can drop by and visit your photo folder any time they get the urge.",https://www.softpedia.com/get/Internet/File-Sharing/SendLink.shtml
File Sharing,SendLink,"One neat way to share the photos in a folder is to send them as a slideshow. This presents the remote user with a Web page that includes a viewable copy of individual photos, as well as a simple means of sequencing to other photos in the folder. Naturally, they can also download a copy of the photo file to their own computer.",https://www.softpedia.com/get/Internet/File-Sharing/SendLink.shtml
File Sharing,SendLink,You can also flag a folder to be sent as an index. This presents the photos to the remote user as a list of files in their Web browser.

File Sharing,SendLink,"If you have a particular photo that you wish to send someone, you can simply email a link to that file.

They just don't want their inbox nuked every time you use your digital camera.",https://www.softpedia.com/get/Internet/File-Sharing/SendLink.shtml
File Sharing,SendLink,"The explosion in popularity of digital video cameras, together with the ready availability of video editing software packages such as Windows Movie Maker, has created what might be considered the perfect storm for the proliferation of very large files. Whether you are creating videos of your children's birthday parties or your own short films, the question becomes how do you move these monsters around so that other people can see them?",https://www.softpedia.com/get/Internet/File-Sharing/SendLink.shtml
File Sharing,SendLink,SendLink is the perfect solution to this problem. Simply send them tiny links to those monster files.,https://www.softpedia.com/get/Internet/File-Sharing/SendLink.shtml
File Sharing,SendLink,"Would you like to share file types other than pictures? We have created what we hope you will agree is a very simple way to share any type of file at all. To us, they are all just bits and bytes.",https://www.softpedia.com/get/Internet/File-Sharing/SendLink.shtml
File Sharing,SendLink,"From a legal perspective, however, some are not just bits and bytes. Some of these files, or collections of files, represent the fruit of someone's labor. These files are said to be copyrighted. This means that the creator of these files has the right to determine the conditions under which copies may be made. SendLink is such a copyrighted work. We work hard to make it the best we can. And we are constantly trying to improve it. Many music and video files are copyrighted works, as well. And the artists who created these works feel the same way about their work. They love what they do and cannot envision doing anything else, but they have the right to control the conditions under which copies may be made. This is where your personal responsibility lies  to ensure that you only share files that you have the right to share.",https://www.softpedia.com/get/Internet/File-Sharing/SendLink.shtml
File Sharing,SendLink,"And speaking of simple, remote users need no additional software whatsoever to receive your files. None. Nada. Zip. If they have a working Web browser and email program  and who doesn't these days  they can download a file or view the contents of a folder that you have chosen to share using SendLink.",https://www.softpedia.com/get/Internet/File-Sharing/SendLink.shtml
File Sharing,SendLink,"Most of us have experienced problems trying to send attachments through email. Especially large files. Some email systems do not allow file attachments of a certain type or bigger than a certain size. And these days, with viruses running rampant around the Internet, many email systems strip out all file attachments, regardless of size or type.",https://www.softpedia.com/get/Internet/File-Sharing/SendLink.shtml
File Sharing,SendLink,"SendLink allows you to send very large files by emailing only a very small link to the file, the same way a webpage contains links to other files without containing those files themselves. The file itself gets downloaded from your computer later, when the recipient of your email clicks on the link in your message. Because your email remains small, regardless of the size of the file you are sending, you will not be the one to clog someone else's inbox. And because no files are being attached to the email itself, the files you need to send will not be stripped out.",https://www.softpedia.com/get/Internet/File-Sharing/SendLink.shtml
File Sharing,SendLink,Files sent using SendLink never pass through the email system used to send the link. This totally sidesteps the technical limitations and privacy issues involved in sending files through email.,https://www.softpedia.com/get/Internet/File-Sharing/SendLink.shtml
File Sharing,SendLink,"Many file sharing programs out there let essentially anyone in the world access your files without restriction. SendLink takes a different approach, called controlled access, that enhances the privacy of your files without inhibiting your ability to share with the people you intend to share with.",https://www.softpedia.com/get/Internet/File-Sharing/SendLink.shtml
File Sharing,SendLink,"The basis for controlled access to the files and folders on your computer is a link, which acts as a tiny permission slip. Links are encoded so that only someone who has a link originating from you is able to retrieve the associated file or folder from your computer using SendLink. And links allow you to share the files and folders on your computer wherever they happen to be. You don't have to move them to a special folder in order to share them.",https://www.softpedia.com/get/Internet/File-Sharing/SendLink.shtml
File Sharing,SendLink,"If you wish to enhance the privacy of your shared files and folders, you may use password protection. Passwords are assigned on a link-by-link basis, giving you the ultimate flexibility in controlling access to your shared content.",https://www.softpedia.com/get/Internet/File-Sharing/SendLink.shtml
File Sharing,SendLink,"If you delete a link from SendLink, even those who have received links from you can no longer retrieve the associated file or folder. But other links to the same file or folder will continue to work just fine. SendLink gives you control over not only which files can be downloaded, but by whom.",https://www.softpedia.com/get/Internet/File-Sharing/SendLink.shtml
File Sharing,SendLink,"To further enhance the privacy of your files and your computer, you can choose to run SendLink selectively. When SendLink is not running, links will not work. Period.
